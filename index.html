            <p>Hi! I'm Johnnatan Nascimento, a linguist and educator with a Master's degree in Linguistics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I am currently completing my PhD in Linguistics at the Université du Québec à Montréal. I have taught at the Classics Department of McGill University, Bishop's University, and the Languages Department of Cégep de Lévis. My teaching experience includes Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, fundamental linguistics courses, and comparative/historical linguistics.</p>
            <p>My research focuses on historical linguistics, specifically comparative Indo-European languages, verbal morphology, grammaticalization, and nanosyntax. I use technological tools to improve learning outcomes. Beyond academia, I work to make linguistics accessible to broader audiences.</p>
